## Overview

This Python script provides a Boggle board solver that determines whether a given string is a valid guess on a Boggle board according to the rules of the game. A Boggle board is a 2D array of individual characters, and valid guesses are strings that can be formed by connecting adjacent cells (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) without reusing any previously used cells.
## Usage

1. **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository or create a new Python file and paste the code.

3. **Using the Function:** Use the `find_word` function by passing a word as an argument.

  

  ## Example
  For example, running the program with the provided input:

  ```bash
 testBoard = [
      ["E","A","R","A"],
      ["N","L","E","C"],
      ["I","A","I","S"],
      ["B","Y","O","R"]
    ]
    
  

  ```
  will result in the output:

   ```bash
   Test passed
   ```
